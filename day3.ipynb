    "This is defined as the probability of an event occurring, assuming that one or more other events have already occurred. Two events, $ A $ and $ B $ are considered to be independent if event $ A $ has no effect on the probability of event $ B $ (i.e. $ P(B|A) = P(B) $). If events $ A $ and $ B $ are not independent, then we must consider the probability that both events occur. This can be referred to as the intersection of events $ A $ and $ B $, defined as $ P(A\\cap B) = P(B|A)⋅P(A) $. We can then use this definition to find the conditional probability by dividing the probability of the intersection of the two events ($ A \\cap B $) by the probability of the event that is assumed to have already occurred (event $ A $):\n",

    "There are four possible options with equal probability (BB, BG, GB, GG). Given that one child is a boy, option GG is excluded, which leaves 3 possible outcomes, of which only one matches the question. This gives a probability of 1/3. However, it exists different view on a problem: given that family already has one child, there are two possible outcomes for the second child (B or G), which gives a probability of 1∕2.
